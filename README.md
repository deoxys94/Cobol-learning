# Cobol-learning

I recently started to learn COBOL. I have discovered COBOL is such an interesting, yet (sort of) a challenging language to learn. This repo hosts everything I have done with COBOL so far: exercises from books, small personal projects, and the JCLs needed to run everything in the mainframe emulator I use.
